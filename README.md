With denoise: Self-supervised Low Light Image Enhancement and Denoising [code](https://github.com/hitzhangyu/V2-Self-supervised-Image-Enhancement-Network-Training-With-Low-Light-Images-Only),[paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349683113_Self-supervised_Low_Light_Image_Enhancement_and_Denoising)

Thanks to weichen: [code](https://github.com/weichen582/RetinexNet),the code refers to their work, and the training data can be 
downloaded from their web page, 

Code has been tested with tensorflow==2.2.0

train：

      python main.py
      
test:

      python main.py --phase=test

On your own computer, you may need to modify the data path

If you find any problems, please let me know，we will appreciate it！

A new version with denoise is about to be completed！code will be available at [V2](https://github.com/hitzhangyu/V2-Self-supervised-Image-Enhancement-Network-Training-With-Low-Light-Images-Only)
